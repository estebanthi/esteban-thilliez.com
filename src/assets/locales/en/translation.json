  "about.content": "Hello, I'm Esteban - AI engineer and developer with multiple passions and an entrepreneurial spirit.\n\nI started in 2020 with my first online store, fueling my passion for web development and entrepreneurship. Since then, I've launched several stores and blogs, either by developing everything myself, \"by hand\", or by using solutions like Shopify and WooCommerce. I also discovered SEO, and automated and optimized my business by developing various tools and using data science (to choose the best words for SEO for example).\n\nIn 2021, I discovered React and developed with this framework, a blog where I talk about Python programming, also offering articles in the form of training. I also did my first projects for clients starting with an intranet for a startup incubator.\n\nAt the same time, I discovered algorithmic trading and started developing solutions either open-source or for clients, and discovering cloud solutions with Amazon, Google and Oracle, or deployment on Raspberry Pi.\n\nIn 2022, I continued to create websites for clients, while offering web writing services and starting a blog on Medium.\n\nIn 2023, I chose to specialize in artificial intelligence to finish my engineering cycle, and so I started a few projects, including generating images to enrich the dataset of an agri-food optical sorter. At the same time, I developed a suite of tools to optimize my activity related to marketplaces like Vinted, Leboncoin, Wallapop, and I launched a YouTube channel to express my passion for the piano.\n\nIn 2024, I completed my studies and did my end-of-studies internship at Worldline as an Artificial Intelligence Engineer, where I developed and experimented with anti-spam email filtering approaches in a big data context (several tens of millions of emails per day). At the same time, demand is growing for the suite of tools for e-merchants that I design, so I commercialize them and manage hosting on AWS and deployment via Terraform, Ansible, and Kubernetes.\n\nToday, I still have many projects in mind, including designing a site for revising theoretical aeronautical exams and a mobile application for counting calories and macros from photos.",
